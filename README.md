## Project Description

Travel Itineraries is a web application designed to help travellers with the difficulties of planning a trip by creating a space to create and share itineraries, saving time and hassle from trip planning and allowing travellers to engage during their trip planning. 

## Package Installation
- Clone repository: git clone https://github.com/Stanley-C-02/f2024-cps731-team3.git
- Install dependencies: npm install
- Install supabase dependency (if not already): npm install @supabase/supabase-js
- Run the application: npm run dev

## Technologies Used 
- Front-end: React.js, CSS
- Back-end: Javascript
- Database: Supabase
- Version Control: Git, GitHub

## IMPORTANT

The supabase.admin.token.jsx is left blank, since it is a secret key that should only be locally used to test this system. Not having this key prevents the following features of the system:

- Deleting own account
- Banning a user
- Unbanning a user
